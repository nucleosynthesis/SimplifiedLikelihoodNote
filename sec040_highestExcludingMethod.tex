\section{Highest excluding method}
\label{sec:high-exc-method}

A further simplification can be made from the simplified
likelihood defined in Section~\ref{sec:simplified-likelihood}.
Aggregate regions may be defined, which can be overlapping,
and the prediction and uncertainty for each of these regions
released. When deriving limits the recaster may define a
separate likelihood for each of these regions as shown in
Equation~\ref{eq-high-likelihood}.

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{i}=\mathrm{Pois}(n_{i} |\, b_{i} + s_{i}\times\mu)
\times\exp(\frac{(b_i-b_{i,0})^2}{\sigma_{ii}})
\label{eq:high-likelihood}
\end{equation}

where $sigma_{ii}$ is the variance for region $i$. When interpreting 
a model the recaster derives the 95\% upper limit for each of the 
regions separately and takes the exclusion from the bin 
giving the strongest limit for the model. The correlation
scheme does not need to be considered as only one region
provides the limit.
